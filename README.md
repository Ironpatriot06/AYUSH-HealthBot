# 🌿 Ayush Herbal Garden — Vision Document

## Project Overview
Ayush Herbal Garden is a digital reference platform for traditional Ayurvedic medicinal plants. It provides structured, reliable, and searchable information about herbs, their medicinal properties, preparations, and scientific references, making Ayurvedic knowledge accessible to students, researchers, and the general public.

## Problem It Solves
Ayurvedic knowledge is often fragmented across books, research papers, and informal sources. There is no single, structured, and authenticated digital platform that:
- Organizes medicinal plant data
- Links traditional knowledge with scientific references
- Allows secure expert-level content management

Ayush Herbal Garden solves this by offering a centralized, searchable, and admin-controlled herbal knowledge system.

## Target Users (Personas)
- **Students & Researchers**: Learn about Ayurvedic plants with verified references
- **General Public**: Explore medicinal plants and their uses safely
- **Ayurvedic Experts / Admin**: Manage and curate accurate plant data securely

## Vision Statement
To preserve, organize, and digitally empower traditional Ayurvedic knowledge through a modern, secure, and scalable web platform.
